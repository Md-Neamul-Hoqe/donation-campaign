## Features:

- [Search By Category Option](#Search_Option)
- [Store Donation List (in Local Storage)](#Donation_Storage)
- [Pie Chart](#Pie_Chart)

##Search_Option:
In the homepage banner section, there is a search bar used for searching by category. Users can input the desired category and then click the search button to view donations related to that category.

##Donation_Storage:
We use a donation list, donated by the user, stored in the user's browser's local storage to ensure that the list remains available for a long time to show to users. Users can make as many donations as they like, but each donation is stored in local storage as a single entry. For each donation, you will receive a greeting to confirm that the donation process has been completed.

##Pie_Chart:
We utilize a pie chart to display the statistics of a user's donations. In this chart, users can visually observe the percentage of donations they have contributed compared to the total available donations.
